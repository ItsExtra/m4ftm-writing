    8 Outrageous Things Gay Men Say to Trans Men
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As a bisexual trans man who passes, I deal with a lot of "surprise" reactions from all sorts of people when I reveal my status. When it comes to sexual and romantic interactions — from dance parties to apps — a majority of the time I have to do a little trans 101. Cisgender gay men seem to lack an understanding of trans etiquette and manners.<br /> Of course, I've dated a few lovely cis gay men, but 8 out of 10 times, our conversations lack dignity on their end. Here are eight outrageous things gay cis men say to trans men.

    My friend is a gay-identified FTM. He’s hot, he’s cute, and above the waist, you would never guess what he’s got down below. We love to kiss and cuddle, and from my end, his blowjobs are great. The problem is that I have no idea how to reciprocate. He isn’t into anal (why would he be, without a prostate?), there’s no cock for me to suck, and what he does have down below doesn’t interest either of us.<br /> <br />Do you have any ideas on how I could turn him on and get him off? It’s starting to frustrate me. Getting bottom work done is a long way off with the current finances.

It's been years since I had top surgery and I don't really think about my chest anymore. My scars aren't obvious since my chest hair covers them. I can't feel my nipples much.<br />For the most part pre bottom surgery I would just lower my pants enough for you to get it in. Anal only. The clit does grow into a small penis. I was lucky enough with growth I could pull back the skin on my pubic bone and have it sit above my thighs with my legs closed.<br />Like this but laying down<br /><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://imgur.com/a/jJZq2WY" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/jJZq2WY</a><br />This kept the vag out of view and made it accessible for sucking. It won't smell or taste like pussy. Testosterone will change the smell and taste to that of a man. I've tasted both cis men, cis women, and myself.<br />When most people think FTM surgery they think of phalloplasty. That's where they take a graft from somewhere, like your arm, and make you a big dick out of it. There is a more common surgery where they take what grew, re position it so it's where a dick should be. They can hook up your urethra and put in testicle implants.<br /><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://i.imgur.com/eozhpiB.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/eozhpiB.jpg</a><br />Best case scenario you look like that David statue by Michelangelo.<br /><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://i.imgur.com/G4ztJ0z.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/G4ztJ0z.jpg</a><br />More commonly it's more like that guy from the Hangover movie.<br /><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://i.imgur.com/itSHnQP.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/itSHnQP.jpg</a><br />People talk a lot of shit about phalloplasty. It's been improved a lot over the years since there has been a lot of genital injuries in the ongoing war. They have gotten better at shaping it. You can also get medical tattooing to make it look more realistic. A lot of the pics and all that are shared are old, outdated, or not showing a completed pahllo. It's a very long expensive process with many surgical steps. Trans guys are also bad at falling off the face of the earth after they are done with their transition and tend not to update.<br />Here is one in action. Pretty sure he is fucking a woman, but all you see of her is side butt cheek.<br /><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.xtube.com/video-watch/ftm-fucking-18163112" target="_blank">https://www.xtube.com/video-watch/ftm-fucking-18163112</a><br />Jerking off.

</div><figcaption>I think the key here is to be tactful and to treat them with respect. You aren't obligated to date someone you don't find sexually attractive, no matter the reason. That doesn't make you closed-minded or a bad person, it just means you are in touch with what you like and have developed specific sexual tastes. (Tastes that may or may not change over time.)

  
As far as seeing trans* people as the gender they identify with, I can tell you from experience that it can be a process. And if I hadn't had someone so close to me undergo a transition, I may have had an entirely different experience/perspective.  
Basically, the turning point of acceptance for me was seeing him so much happier as soon as he started living openly and honestly. Until that point I'd never met a trans* person and was probably in a similar boat that you're in. But once I saw the change in his demeanor, I knew that him coming out and coming to terms with his gender identity was only a good thing.  
It's hard to re-train yourself when you grew up using female pronouns and a female name for your younger sibling, but I realized how much harder it had to be for him to come out and come to terms with something like that.  
So yeah, I guess the tl;dr is to be respectful and treat them like the person that they are.</figcaption></figure> <!-- /wp:core-embed/reddit -->

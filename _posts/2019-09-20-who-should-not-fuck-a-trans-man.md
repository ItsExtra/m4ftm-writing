  After all this writing about why and how to fuck trans men, I'd like to bring things down a bit and mention some situations where you should maybe reconsider, because you risk ruining someone else's day.

**You'd be better off with a blow up doll** While some enjoy it, many trans people find it off-putting when they feel the only thing a person is interested in is their weird body. Figure out what *else* you like about them. While I find it weird when someone doesn't want to fuck me just cause of my junk, it's actually much weirder when that is literally the *only* thing they want. Before I learned to identify these guys, I had some really bad sex. Don't treat a trans person like a kinky walk on the wild side, unless that's something they're into. I bet that very few trans people enjoy being thought of us taboo or wild just because of their bodies. **You feel like you should** Maybe you heard about how transphobic cis (non trans) gay guys are and have decided you will do right by your community and fuck a trans person. Wasting a trans guys time so you can use him like a fleshlight, think of someone you actually want to fuck, and check something off your bucket list is not fun for the other people. I have now learned how to filter these people out after some really abysmal sex. **You can't wait to tell your friends** If you are hoping to hook up with a trans guy so you can show your friends how progressive you are, wait until you find someone you would have thought was attractive. If you think this is a good way to boost your social status, you probably aren't as progressive as you think you are.

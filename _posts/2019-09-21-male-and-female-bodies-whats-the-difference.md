## How we all began {#mcetoc_1dl0d1jh71} All fetuses start out with the same anatomy, but at 

[7 weeks][1], changes in anatomy start happening which lead most people to have what we think of as male and female bodies. It's important to note that an [estimated][2] 1% of people have "bodies [that] differ from standard male or female," and 1 in 1,666 people do not have XX (generally associated with females) or XY (thought of as male) chromosomes. Many people who have other chromosome combinations don't even know it, and may be surprised to find this out when they undergo genetic testing for some other reason. I am going to use the terms "male" and "female" here to describe the 99% of people who have bodies that meet the common definitions. Male and female bodies are not as different as you may think. Everyone has basically the same structures, but they develop differently. 
## Junk {#mcetoc_1dl0d1jh73} Here are two really good pictures from

Female bodies have the same structure of erectile tissue as male bodies, but when females get turned on and hard it's not as noticeable because it hugs the body. Wikipedia has a [detailed list][4] of related male and female body parts. But to help you imagine what it feels like to have a female body, here are the basics (not 100% technically accurate but it gets the point across): Head of penis = clitoris Foreskin = hood of clitoris Shaft of penis = erectile tissue under lips Balls = ovaries Ball sack = outer lips Prostate = G Spot <img class=" size-full wp-image-1176 aligncenter" src="file:///Volumes/Five-Drain/___water/Documents/Publii/sites/m4ftm/input/media/posts/7/160302-tmale-genital-anatomy-no-surg.png" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" srcset="file:///Volumes/Five-Drain/___water/Documents/Publii/sites/m4ftm/input/media/posts/7/160302-tmale-genital-anatomy-no-surg.png 597w, http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/160302-tmale-genital-anatomy-no-surg-300x283.png 300w" alt="160302-tmale-genital-anatomy-no-surg" width="597" height="564" />

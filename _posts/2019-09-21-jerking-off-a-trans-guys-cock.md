<p id="mcetoc_1dl0ci7b90">
  Lots of trans guys like being jerked off.
</p> Trans guys who take testosterone (or who took it in the past) will have different junk than those who haven't. They get hard and hot when turned on.You can feel the shaft underneath the foreskin and other flesh and jerk it with your fingers. He might like you to touch the head directly. Use spit or lube to make it slippery. 

<del>there was a picture here</del> Our cocks enjoy the same sort of feelings as yours. Stroking, rubbing, and pressure. Different rhythms and intensities at different times. Try different things and see what works in the moment. <del>there was a picture here</del> **Penetration at the same time— something to ask about** He might like something in his cunt while you're jacking him off too. **But he might not. You must discuss this before trying it.** All the videos below show some front hole penetration. (If you have a good video that only shows stroking, please share it!) You'll notice that the jerking hand sometimes leaves the cock the dip into the hole. That's a good move if your guy is into that. Think of it like how some cis (non trans) guys stop to squeeze their balls sometimes. <del>there was a picture here</del>

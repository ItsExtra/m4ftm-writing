<p id="mcetoc_1dl0d6jqn0">
  This website was created because when I talk to cis (non trans) gay/bi guys online or in real life, there is a lot of nervousness and uncertainty when it comes to the possibilities of playing with trans guys. Some guys feel that being with a trans man means <a href="http://m4ftm.com/2016/02/22/q-if-i-fuck-an-ftm-am-i-still-gay/">they aren't really gay</a>. Some would like to, but are nervous because they don't know what to expect and don't know what they would even <em>do</em> with a trans guy. This leads to pretty severe performance anxiety. To someone who has always, or mostly, only fucked people with a body quite similar to their own, trying something new can be daunting.

## Goals {#mcetoc_1dl0d6jqn2}

*   Provide a sexy and educational place where gay/bi/queer cis men can learn about fucking and hooking up gay/bi/queer trans men
*   Dispel myths about trans men
*   Use language and media that are accessible to a variety of audiences
*   Represent diverse experiences and realities of trans men
*   Incorporate feedback from trans and gay communities as appropriate

## What do you think? {#mcetoc_1dl0d6jqn3} If you are a cis or trans guy who has some experience or thoughts, and you think you have something to add, or a correction to make, 

[please leave feedback][1]. If you are a cis guy and there is something you would like to have covered, you can [ask a question][2] and maybe we will cover it in the future.

"<a href="https://www.out.com/health/2019/3/22/what-you-need-know-about-prep-demand" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">On demand</a>" also known as "2 1 1" and "event based" dosing where you take Truveda only when you are going to engage in risk activity and then for a day after, was demonstrated <a href="https://www.iwantprepnow.co.uk/prep-trials/#ipergay" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">effective</a> in cis gay men in the <a href="http://www.hivnet.ubc.ca/clinical-trials/ctn268/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ippergay</a> trial in France.

*However* data from cis heterosexual studies show that the drug takes longer to build up to an effective level in the front hole, so anyone whose risk involves that will need to take it for a longer time. The video indicates 7 days before and 28 days after though I have also seen 28 before and 28 after.

We are <a href="http://www.hivequal.org/hiv-equal-online/trans-men-the-invisible-battle-with-hiv" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">lacking in adequate data to really know</a> what will or won't work for trans men. So this is sort of speculative at this point.

When I was initially prescribed this my MD was not aware of the difference in recommendation for cis and trans men so instructed me in the "on demand" system. Luckily I learned of the mistake before anything happened.

<p id="mcetoc_1dl0d4bl20">
  This site has been getting some really good feedback and the ideas are being integrated. Here is a summary of specific thingsthat are planned.
</p>

*   A page about language, particularly with regards to body parts. Eg cock vs clit. I have most of a draft about this in progress. It will be called "talking dirty to trans men" (Suggested by basically everyone who sent feedback)
*   Something about binders. Not sure where this will fit yet.
*   Page about homologus anatomy, started but not adequate. Hoping for assistance on this.
*   Update the page on genderqueers and other IDs. I am not the right person to do this, so I await assistance.
*   Orgasms: what they are, what they look like. Not started, currently gathering feedback and ideas.
*   It seems like talking more about men who've had surgeries to their junk might be in order, but I don't know much about this, so I await assistance.
*   Sites to link to: [Trans fag sex journals][1]
